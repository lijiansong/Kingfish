Hi VPN masks your IP address, encrypts your Internet traffic, protects your privacy with a secure connection on public Wi-Fi and helps unblock websites and bypass apps, watching online videos so that you can access any restricted content safely and anonymously.\n\nWhy Choose Hi VPN?\n\n✓ Extremely fast, and free forever.\n✓ Large number of servers covering all around the world.\n✓ All-new designed app with an unprecedented smooth experience.\n✓ Intelligently choose the fastest and highest quality server.\n✓ No limit on traffic and usage time at all.\n✓ No need to register or login, no account required.\n✓ No tracking of your network access, no log storage.\n✓ No additional permissions required.\n✓ Works with Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G, and all mobile cellular data carriers.\n\nInstall Hi VPN Now You Can:\n\n► Unblock geo-restricted contents\n\nEncrypt all your traffic and allow your favorite services and networks wherever you are. Now you can enjoy Netflix videos, Spotify music and BBC iPlayer videos around the world as you travel.\n\n► Bypass government censorship and network restrictions\n\nConnect to your favorite websites and apps, such as Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, even if you are in a restricted network.\n\n► Break through school network firewall restrictions\n\nYou can freely use any social media and streaming services by breaking through the limitations of the school network firewall when you connect to the campus network, or use the school’s computer to access the Internet.\n\n► Stay anonymous online and protect privacy\n\nUsing Hi VPN, your IP and location will be masked and your activities can no longer be tracked on the Internet. AnyLink is fully committed to your Internet privacy and keeps no logs of your activity, even if someone requests the data of our VPN service users, we have none to provide.\n\n► Secure your device and your mobile data\n\nHi VPN secures your Android device’s connection while you’re connected to public Wi-Fi hotspots or cellular data networks. It works just like a free Tor proxy (the Onion Router) but it’s even more secured. Your password and your personal data are secured and you are protected from hacker attacks.\n\n► Largest range of country and region coverage\n\nHi VPN offers tens of thousands of servers in dozens of countries including the United States, Canada, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, India and more, which gives you more choices and better connection speeds.\n\n► Free and unlimited, forever\n\nAs we promise, Hi VPN always keep free and unlimited, and will continue forever. (Hi VPN free version may show some ads. Upgrade to AnyLink Premium to enjoy ad-free VPN, if you prefer.)\n\nWhat is a VPN and Why Would I Need One?\n\nA VPN, or Virtual Private Network, allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the Internet. VPNs can be used to access region-restricted websites, shield your browsing activity from prying eyes on public Wi-Fi, and more.\n\nIn very simple terms, a VPN connects your PC, smartphone, or tablet to another computer (called a server) somewhere on the internet, and allows you to browse the internet using that computer’s internet connection. So if that server is in a different country, it will appear as if you are coming from that country, and you can potentially access things that you couldn’t normally.\n\nThe vast majority of people these days are using VPN for torrenting or bypassing geographic restrictions to watch content in a different country. They are still very useful for protecting yourself while working at a coffee shop, but that’s hardly the primary use anymore.\n\nCopyright © 2018 Hi Security Lab. All Rights Reserved.'}

Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.\n\nIndividual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.\n\nVPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.\n\nMobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network."}

Your password and your personal data are secured and you are protected from hacker attacks.\n\n► Surf anonymously at Fast Speed\n\nBetternet is fast! It detects your location automatically and connects you to the nearest and fastest server. As a result, your connection will be much faster than any other VPN or proxy providers.\n\n► Shield WiFi Hotspot\n\nPublic Wi-Fi hotspots are perfect places for hackers and if they happen to get a hold of your personal information, you could very well be the next victim of identity theft!

The barrier of entry is nonexistent. No excuses: you ALWAYS have 5 minutes! \n🕹️ Effortless practice: We took a good look at why games are so fun and addictive and injected the essence into Drops to create an app that is freakishly immersive but in this case you don’t waste your time playing instead you build a valuable asset: knowledge of a new language.\n⚡Rapid pace: We believe in quick pace and typing on your phone’s keyboard is nothing but fast. Say hello to rapid swipes and taps! You’ll need those extra seconds to get the most out of your 5 minutes ;)\n🎯 Vocabulary focus: No grammar, only curated words with high practical value. Drops focuses on one thing and it does it extremely well. Drops also teaches “alphabet” courses for beginners in Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Hebrew, Arabic, Russian and Hindi.\n💁Forge learning habit: Drops wants to convert you into a language learning addict. No matter how effective your learning tool is, if you don’t use it on a daily basis, it doesn’t really matter. Drops tricks your mind and you’ll be better for it!\n\nLanguages in Drops\nWe are proud of the wide range of languages that you can learn with Drops and we are adding new ones nearly every month.

No you can choose between Mandarin Chinese & Cantonese Chinese, Castilian Spanish & Latin-American Spanish, American English & British English and between European Portuguese & Brazilian Portuguese. You can even learn each language simultaneously for free!\nWe are extremely proud to our beautiful word pronunciations recorded by voice actresses and actors!\n\nDrops offer a complete package for free for casual learners: 5 minutes of blazingly fast and epic fun learning per day, more than 1700 words in 99 topics. More dedicated language learners can subscribe for premium features to achieve much faster progress and of course provides unlimited learning time. \n🌍 Our mission at Drops is to empower people of the world with the gift of language knowledge via a special tool that uses the universal language we all speak: images.\n\n\np.s.: We take full responsibility for the potential addiction to language learning.\n\n-----------------\n😍 I’m sure you’ll love Drops as much as we enjoyed making it.

Orbot uses Tor to encrypt your Internet traffic and then hides it by bouncing through a series of computers around the world. Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic analysis.\n\n*** Android 4.0 and lower, you can download older versions from https://guardianproject.info/releases/ or through the FDroid.org open app store at https://f-droid.org. The last release with KitKat and older support is: https://guardianproject.info/releases/Orbot-v14.1.4-UpToKitKat-nonPIE.apk ***\n\n*** SAMSUNG GALAXY USERS ***\nOn some devices, aSamsung app is listening on the same network port that Orbot needs. Download \'SockStat\' from Google Play. Look for the app on port 9050. Force stop and disable that app. You can also try to change Orbot\'s "Tor SOCKS" setting under the Debug section to 9051 or AUTO. You can see the fix in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK-nK4F67_g\n*****\n\nOrbot is the only app that creates a truly private internet connection. As the New York Times writes, “when a communication arrives from Tor, you can never know where or whom it’s from.” Tor won the 2012 Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Pioneer Award.\n\n★ ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES: Orbot is the safest way to use the Internet on Android. Period. Orbot bounces your encrypted traffic several times through computers around the world, instead of connecting you directly like VPNs and proxies. This process takes a little longer, but the strongest privacy and identity protection available is worth the wait.\n\n★ PRIVATE WEB SURFING: Use with Orfox, the most anonymous way to access any website, even if it’s normally blocked, monitored, or on the hidden web. Get Orfox: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.orfox\n\n★ PRIVACY FOR APPS: Any installed app can use Tor through Orbot\'s built-in VPN\n\n★ PRIVACY FOR EVERYONE: Tor can help you confidentially research a competitor, get around someone blocking your favorite site, or circumvent a firewall to watch sports at work.\n\n★ PRIVACY MADE EASY: Check out our fun, interactive walkthrough: https://guardianproject.info/howto/browsefreely\n\n★ IT’S OFFICIAL: This is the official version of the Tor onion routing service for Android.\n\n***We Love Feedback***\n★ ABOUT US: Guardian Project is a group of developers that make secure mobile apps and open-source code for a better tomorrow.\n★ OPEN-SOURCE: Orbot is free software.

After, you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication for work, school, and non-Microsoft accounts.

You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each.

To-Do syncs between your phone and computer, so you can access your to-do from school, the office or the supermarket, or even whilst you’re traveling around the world. \n\nShare your lists with family and colleagues \n\nList sharing enables you to collaborate on common lists and tasks and achieve your goals seamlessly. Whether you want to share a list of work items with your teams or a shopping list with your partner, with our share link, we make it easy to coordinate and collaborate in small teams and one-on-one. Getting things done together has never been easier! \n\nBreak down your task into smaller, actionable items \n\nSteps (Subtasks) allow any to-do to be broken down into smaller, more actionable pieces. To help customers be even more productive, each to-do will display just how many steps (subtasks) it contains and how many of those steps have been completed so far. Steps (Subtasks) will also maintain their completion state even as the to-do they belong to is marked as completed or incomplete. \n\nSet due dates and reminders \n\nYou can quickly add, organise and schedule your to-dos whilst you’re on the go. With important to-dos that you really shouldn’t forget, you can add reminders and due dates – we’ll remember them for you.

You can collect all of your tasks and notes in one place to help you achieve more. \n\nColour-coding your lists \n\nWhat areas of your life do you want to be more productive in? You can have a colour-coded list for each. Now you can quickly add your homework to one list, your shopping to another, your packing list, your work projects and your home DIY projects to yet more lists. And if you follow a productivity system, such as GTD (David Allen’s Getting Things Done Methodology), then you can create a Someday list or a Follow-up list. \n\nOutlook integration \n\nWith the integration with Outlook Mail, you can view your tasks on your Outlook Desktop client or on Outlook.com using the same Microsoft Account. All to-dos are stored on Exchange Online servers, so they will be shown in both Microsoft To-Do and Outlook Tasks automatically. \n\nPlan what you want to focus on each morning and give yourself a powerful productivity boost for the day. This simple to-do list app is free to download and use. It includes customisable themes, notes, reminders, due dates, smart Suggestions and syncing across multiple devices. In short, everything you need to manage your life and accomplish more. Completing your jobs or housework has never been so easy.

Pure Writer is minimalistic and it allows you to write at your heart\'s content anytime, anywhere without fearing that you\'ll lose your content ever again.\n\nWith Pure Writer\'s line and paragraph spacing feature, your text will be clearer and more comfortable to read. Not only that, but it also has smooth scrolling, swipe-to-collapse-keyboard, and many more exciting features. \n\nSimplicity is hidden complexity. You are able to encrypt your work with your fingerprint, start or stop writing whenever you wish, and share your content quickly to other apps — we\'ve got you covered. \n\nMost importantly, unless you manually delete it, you will never ever lose your work while using this text editor. Be it an accidental deletion or an unexpected shutdown, you will still be able to recover it from the History.\n\nWhen you are satisfied with your content, you can select the share button on the top right corner of the screen and send it elsewhere or start a new article. \n\nYou can now clear this page with the clear button on the top right corner of this screen and start writing. If you accidentally delete anything, you will be able to recover it from the History records. \n\nWe value your work and hope you\'ll enjoy using Pure Writer.\n\nPure Writer - Protective Mechanism\n\nThe current protective mechanism that Pure Writer has is: \n\n1. The article will be saved once the content is changed. If that fails, Pure Writer will notify the user immediately. \n\n2. Pure Writer will check if your content is saved in the database every two seconds. If it fails, Pure Writer will notify the user immediately. \n\n3. If it fails to autosave, then the users will not be able to exit the app completely. Pressing the exit button at this time is the same as pressing the Home button without completely stopping the app. This will allow some time for the user to manually save their content. \n\n4. Every time the app is running in the background or exited, it will automatically backup the whole database if any content is edited. The backup file can be accessed anytime. The backup will be saved along with the previous version of the backup to allow users to revert the backup.\n\n5. The History record, undo and redo feature is provided to every article \n\n6. Has a Trash folder to prevent accidental deletion of articles.\n\n7. Cloud backups: if Pure Writer is integrated with WebDAV, then it will automatically backup all the database content including the articles to the cloud.'}

That's why Google Fit worked with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you two new activity goals that can help improve your health: Move Minutes and Heart Points\n\n• Move Minutes\nWhen it comes to your health, it's important to move more and sit less. Earn Move Minutes for all of your activity and get motivated to make small, healthier changes throughout your day, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or catching up with a friend over a walk instead of a coffee.\n\n• Heart Points\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity, like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30 minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity, which is shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental well-being.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nTRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCH\nGet instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides. Fit will use your Android phone's sensors or Wear OS by Google smartwatch's heart rate sensors to record your speed, pace, route, and more.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress for Heart Points and Move Minutes. Meeting your goals each day? Based on your activity and goal progress, Google Fit will help you adjust them so you can keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE ALL YOUR MOVEMENT COUNT\nIf you walk, run, or bike during the day, your Android phone or Wear OS by Google smartwatch will automatically detect and add your activities to your Google Fit journal to ensure you get credit for every move. Enjoy a different type of workout? Select it from a list of activities like pilates, rowing, or spinning, and Google Fit will track all the Heart Points and Move Minutes you earn.\n\nGET COACHING THAT FITS YOU\nGet customized tips and actionable coaching, like help adjusting your goals based on your activity\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nFit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices to give you a holistic view of your health, so you'll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Wear OS by Google, Nike+, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Lifesum, Basis, Sleep as Android, Withings, Xiaomi Mi bands, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANY TIME\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Fit and your integrated apps in the redesigned journal.\n\nLearn more about Google Fit and see a list of supported apps at: www.google.com/fit"}

Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.\n\nIndividual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.\n\nVPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.\n\nMobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network.\n\nWhat is a VPN, in a simple explanation?\n\nA VPN creates a secure, encrypted “tunnel” over the internet between your computer, smartphone or tablet and whatever website or app you are trying to access.\n\nThis is made possible by redirecting your connection via a VPN server in another country, which makes it appear to a website or application that you are just another ‘local’ visitor.\n\nYou become effectively anonymous as your IP address (the numerical label that identifies your device’s online connection) is replaced with that of the VPN server.\n\nWhen you want to mask your real location, simply launch the VPN app, select the country from which you want to connect then off you go! After that, simply use your browser and any apps as you would normally do.\n\nTry it now.\nDon't forget to give us 5-Star (★ ★ ★ ★ ★) rating, if you like us.\nshare it with your friends, if you would like to help us.\n\nIf you have any feedback or suggestions, please write it in the review , will be happy to hear from you."}

Surf freely now!', 'description': 'Unable to access some websites or apps? Worried about unprotected Wi-Fi hotspots? Want to be anonymous and protected from surveillance and hackers? Touch VPN – is the best solution for you!\n\nPublic Wi-Fi is not safe. Anything you send or receive on your mobile devices on public WiFi can be intercepted, which makes your personal information such as your passwords, pictures, app data and other private information vulnerable to hackers. \n\nTouch VPN automatically turns public WiFi into safe and secure private WiFi. Your mobile security, privacy and personal information will be protected from hackers, identity theft, and other malicious activities when we detect a public WiFi network. \n\nTouch VPN is powered by one of the most trusted privacy, security and access provider - Hotspot Shield.\n\nHighlights of Touch VPN:\n\n✓ Free: 100% free. No credit card information needed. No trials offered.\n✓ Unlimited: Truly unlimited. No session, speed or bandwidth limitations. \n✓ Simple: Unblock the world with just one touch of the “Connect” button. \n✓ Secured: Our strong SSL encryption will make you fully anonymous and secured.\n✓ Support: If you have any feedback or suggestions, please send an email to: support@northghost.com!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n■ What is a VPN\n\nVPN stands for Virtual Private Network. When connecting to a VPN server through Touch VPN for example - it sets up a secured and encrypted connection to the server in another country. Because of the encryption process the data cannot be filtered or blocked. If you live in Sweden for example, when connect to a VPN server in US, your traffic would look like coming from the United States, instead of Sweden. \n\n■ Why using a VPN\n\nWith a VPN, you are not only able to unblock geo-restricted or censored services, such as Facebook, Pandora and Youtube; your online privacy and security will be greatly bolstered as you’ll be surfing the web completely anonymously.\n\n■ VPN vs. Proxy\n\nVPN and Proxy can both conceal user identity through re-routing your internet traffic and change your IP. A Proxy server is however, completely browser based, whether you are using Chrome, Safari, or Firefox; and might not be compatible with certain web pages that use non-browser technology. Unlike a Proxy, a VPN service encrypts all your traffic, and will work with all internet based services. In summary, VPN will provide you with more online freedom, privacy and security.\n\n■ Why Touch VPN\n\nTouch VPN is 100% free, unlimited, secured and super easy to use. You can connect to any of the servers below (Sweden, United Kingdom, Denmark, France, United States, Netherlands, and Canada) to enjoy unlimited online privacy and freedom. With Touch VPN you can \n\n⇨ Access any website in any country. Bypass geo-restrictions to unblock any website wherever you are! Get access to sites that are blocked or censored by government, school or workplace. Evade firewalls to unblock Facebook, watch YouTube, and circumvent VOIP limitations. \n\n⇨ Protect Your Data from Hackers. When you’re connected to a public Wi-Fi Hotspot, your name, passwords, and personal information can be easily compromised. Touch VPN encrypts your data and provides you with banking-level security for the best protection.\n\n⇨ Touch VPN is a one-click VPN Proxy Service. Touch VPN contains only one button. The button connects you to one of many anonymous servers at speeds faster than a web proxy. When you are not running our app we help you save your devices battery. And, we are a completely unlimited and free VPN!\n\n⇨ Surf the Web Anonymously. Avoid being snooped by your ISP and prevent websites from ad tracking and targeting. Touch VPN changes your IP address, so your online identity is anonymous and your internet activity is inaccessible to prying eyes and businesses.\n\n0x33FF1B42'}

When all the bulbs were illuminated it means that everything is connected and your work is done. \n\nHow many levels are there?\n\nLoop Energy is based on a logic of never-ending levels. Knowing this, you will never get bored solving the same puzzles; there will be an infinite number of puzzles to solve and everyone will play the exact same levels: If you are in the level 1000 and someone else is also on level 1000, you will be both playing the same exact level. \n\nDo I need to pay anything to play?\n\nEnergy is completely free and you don’t need to pay for playing the game.

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of over 20,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage in North America is also supplemented by real-time radar data. Coverage is variable and subject to change at any time.\n\nConnect with Flightradar24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist.\nemail (support@fr24.com)\ntwitter (@flightradar24)\nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDisclaimer\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

{'title': '∞ Infinity Loop', 'package_name': 'com.balysv.loop', 'rating': 4.6, 'downloads': '10,000,000+', 'category': 'Puzzle', 'short_desc': 'Simple, relaxing, endless game.', 'description': 'Simple, relaxing, endless game. People love it!\n\n∞ Infinity Loop is the most trending game in 2018. It can be considered a puzzle game about creating intricate looping patterns or just the application of using a simple concept: "connecting multiple things" and make fun out of it.\n\nSome people say this game is a good puzzle game but with a great zen mode. The goal is to clear your mind, remove the stress from your daily life without any pressure or tension to solve the levels. \n\nIf you are looking for a stress relief or a relaxing game type, enjoy the loop!\n\nFAQ\n\nHow to Play Infinity Loop?\n\nConnect all the lines and corners to make perfect connections. It is like killing the chaos and reaching perfection. Watch the video to overview how it works. Check on youtube as well where several people post the solutions. Nonetheless, we suggest you to try to find yourself how the game works and what are you supposed to do.\n\nHow to Play the Infinity Dark Mode?\n\nThe goal of the dark mode is to make disconnections, breaking it all and not leaving a single piece connected.\n\nHow many levels the game has?\n\nInfinite.\n\nHow can I save my game progress?\n\nMake sure you connect the app with Google Play Games on the settings panel (the button is in the bottom of the gameplay). This way your progress won\'t be lost. If you face further issues reach us by e-mail.\n\nDo I need to pay anything to play Infinity Loop?\n\nNo. The original game is 100% free. There is no need to pay anything for the original game. The game is free for unlimited levels. Only if you opt for the secondary game, called "black mode", you may need to pay a coffee for it after level 100.\n\nI don\'t feel the game is challenging. Why?\n\nThe challenge for us would be making the game with increasing difficulty after a certain level while at the same time relaxing and allowing infinity levels. So how could level 100.000 be more difficult than level 10.000? It is hard. So as we cannot have the best in all worlds, we have opted to make it relaxing for now. \n\nNote: This game is also available on Android Wear and Android Watches. And it\'s very fun as well!\n\nConcept and Development: Jonas Lekevicius, Balys Valentukevicius & the WebAvenue LTD Team\n\nDesign & Logo Copyright: Alice Gmyrko & the WebAvenue LTD Team'}
